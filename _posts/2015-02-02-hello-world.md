I believe life is a lot like a videogame. You have certain actions you need to do, and you can have a few goals that you need to achieve to beat the game. Along the way you collect things of value, and have fun with the stuff around you, gaining experience and leveling up.

Well, this blog is about leveling up for me. I'm always trying to look for ways I can improve as a person and as a coder. That's why I'm creating this blog about my habits as a coder, and to write about the technical problems I face every day and how I choose to solve them. My goal is to have a better understanding of these things while I attempt to put it in writing, and try to explain them in a clear way, and hopefully what I write can be of help to someone in the same situation as me.

This blog will also serve as a way of exploring new ideas that occur to me, reflecting thoughts on the industry of software developemnt, my journey through learning new programming languages and/or technology, and improving my english communication skills, since english is not my native tongue, as it may already be evident.

Perhaps the purpose of the blog will evolve over time, but in the meantime, I'm excited to start, so let's get to work!
