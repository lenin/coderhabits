Hey, I'm Lenin. I'm a software developer. I spend most of my time writing code, but I also like to do other things like play basketball, lift weights, play guitar, contemplate the emptiness of the universe from my meditation chamber, and enjoy life in general. I have another site at [leninyee.com](http://leninyee.com), if you want to drop by.

This blog will mainly be about my habits as a coder, and what I do to solve the technical problems I face every day. I'll write about software development in general, tecnology, and basically all the things I'm interested in and relate in some way to coding.

I'll update this page as the site has more content.
